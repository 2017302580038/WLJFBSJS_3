### 选作2道题

**P4**

a. http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/cs453/index.html

b. HTTP 1.1

c. Persistent connection. From "Connection:keep-alive"

d. We don't know, the IP address isn't provided in the response message.

e. The browser is Netscape, judged from User-Agent. The web page may be kind of different for different kinds of browsers, so the broswer type is needed in HTTP request message so that the web server can response with the proper version of the specific web object. 

**P9**

a. Suppose that AAT = Average Access Time delay, Total = total response time

So Δ = 850000/15728640 = 0.054s, β = 16Δ = 0.865

and AAT = Δ/(1-Δβ) = 0.0567 s

So the total response time is Total = AAT + 3 = 3.0567 s

b. With the hit rate 0.4, we have the new β_1 = 0.6β = 0.519

We can assume that if the request hit the cache, the LAN response time can be ignored.

So Total = 0.6 * (3 + Δ/(1-Δβ_1)) = 1.833 s

The overview of similar network is shown in the following figure:
