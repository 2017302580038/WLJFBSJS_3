### a.

*delta* = *L* / *R* = 850000 / 15000000 = 0.0567 sec

Average access delay = *delta* / (1 - *delta* * *beta*) = 0.0567 / (1 - 0.907) = 0.6 sec

Average Internet delay = 3 sec

Total average response time = 3 + 0.6 = 3.6 sec

### b.

Miss rate = 0.4

Average access delay = *delta* / (1 - *delta* * *beta* * 0.4) = 0.0567 / (1 - 0.907 * 0.4) = 0.089 sec

The response time is approximately zero if it's hit.

Total response time = 0.6 * 0 + 0.4 * (3 + 0.089) = 1.24 sec
